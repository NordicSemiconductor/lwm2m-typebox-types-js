 * Connectivity Monitoring
 *
 * This LwM2M Object enables monitoring of parameters related to network
 * connectivity.
 * In this general connectivity Object, the Resources are limited to the most
 * general cases common to most network bearers. It is recommended to read the
 * description, which refers to relevant standard development organizations
 * (e.g. 3GPP, IEEE).
 * The goal of the Connectivity Monitoring Object is to carry information
 * reflecting the more up to date values of the current connection for
 * monitoring purposes. Resources such as Link Quality, Radio Signal Strength,
 * Cell ID are retrieved during connected mode at least for cellular networks.
