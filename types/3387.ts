 * doesn't create outgoing events. No sensor or actuator mimicking actions are
 * performed when in disabled mode.)\n* **1: normal** (The local control is
 * fully operational, a superior control object can override the actual control
 * using the northbound interface, but has no guarantee that a sensor or User
 * Interface event overrides this without any warning.)\n* **2: remote** (No
 * actuator actions related to sensor signals received via the eastbound
 * interface are performed. The Remote state is e.g. used to allow the superior
 * control to handle the actuators individually through the westbound interface,
 * using its own algorithms.)\n* **3: local** (Set to local, a control object
 * will no longer execute requests coming through the northbound interface. The
 * sensor mimicking and the control status setting remains operational. This
 * operating mode isolates the control object from superior control objects, and
 * may be used e.g. to support troubleshooting and error triage handling.)\n*
