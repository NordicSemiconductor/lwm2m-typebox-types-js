This Object includes installing a firmware package, updating firmware, and performing actions after updating firmware. The firmware update MAY require to reboot the device; it will depend on a number of factors, such as the operating system architecture and the extent of the updated software.\r\nThe envisioned functionality is to allow a LwM2M Client to connect to any LwM2M Server to obtain a firmware image using the object and resource structure defined in this section experiencing communication security protection using TLS/DTLS. There are, however, other design decisions that need to be taken into account to allow a manufacturer of a device to securely install firmware on a device. Examples for such design decisions are how to manage the firmware update repository at the server side (which may include user interface considerations), the techniques to provide additional application layer security protection of the firmware image, how many versions of firmware images to store on the device, and how to execute the firmware update process considering the hardware specific details of a given IoT hardware product. These aspects are considered to be outside the scope of this version of the specification.\r\nA LwM2M Server may also instruct a LwM2M Client to fetch a firmware image from a dedicated server (instead of pushing firmware images to the LwM2M Client). The Package URI resource is contained in the Firmware object and can be used for this purpose.\r\nA LwM2M Client MUST support block-wise transfer [CoAP_Blockwise] if it implements the Firmware Update object.\r\nA LwM2M Server MUST support block-wise transfer. Other protocols, such as HTTP/HTTPs, MAY also be used for downloading firmware updates (via the Package URI resource).

For CoAP this endpoint MAY be a LwM2M Server but does not necessarily need to be.

This is using straight forward a list of resource contents that are determined by the list elements in their order.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nExample of a simple form:\\n- The key list for reporting ID 1 is: 4001/101; 4021/5850; 4021/100; 4021/102;\\n- The values are: 4001/101:0.5; 4021/5850:false; 4021/100:0.3; 4021/102:7\\n- The coded stream will be: 1; 0.5; false; 0.3; 7 with the first byte 1 the reporting ID.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nThe explicit form, that is used with device status reports, needs to explicitly name the instances the reported values are from. To allow for that two special keys are used:\\n- *NoOfInstances:* This key is to allow several object instances to report their status in the same report, e.g. a Device reports the status of all its light point objects.\\nThe block of keys following NoOfInstances, always starting with InstanceID, until the next NoOfInstances key is present in the status message for every instance, e.g. NoOfInstances=2 means the following block of keys is present twice.\\n- *InstanceID:* This key initiates the report of an object, is the first key before all the resource values. It defines the object instance that reports its status.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nExample of an explicit form:\\n- The key list for reporting ID 2 is: NoOfInstances; InstanceId; 4001/101; NoOfInstances; InstanceId; 4021/100\\n- The coded stream will be 2;2;0;0.5;1;0.7;1;0;0.5 with the first byte 2 the ID of the structure definition, the second byte the number of instances (2), the third the instance ID of the first (0) instance, the reported value, the instance ID of the second (1) instance, the reported value, the number of instances (1) for the next object, the ID of the instance (0) and the value."
